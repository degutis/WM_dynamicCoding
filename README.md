This is the complete pipeline to recreate the analysis and plots in "Neural dynamics of visual working memory representation during sensory distraction" by Degutis, Weber, Soch and Haynes. 
To run everything open 'globalAnalysis.m' and run the code. 
Make sure to have SPM12 and TDT (the decoding toolbox) in the matlab path (see requirements.txt).
